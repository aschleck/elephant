It's kind of like [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai/) but it barely works and it's mine!

Yes I know using Rust was a terrible idea.

### Current state

- [x] Enumerate windows and screenshot them
- [ ] Skip Incognito windows
- [x] Diff windows to detect changes
- [x] Generate some multimodal embeddings
- [ ] Generate better multimodal embeddings
- [x] Store the embeddings
- [x] Make a UI accessible from the status bar
- [ ] Query for best match embeddings from a UI
- [ ] Allow pausing/resuming since Incognito detection is probably impossible
- [ ] Do something with Vision OCR results?
